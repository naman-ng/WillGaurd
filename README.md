# INSPIRATION
The motivation behind the WillGaurd initiative stems from the pressing issue of lost private keys and the ambiguity surrounding the distribution and ownership of digital assets post-demise. In the realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency, private keys are the sole means of managing and accessing digital assets, and their loss renders the assets permanently inaccessible. Moreover, upon the owner's demise, questions may arise regarding the rightful beneficiaries of their digital assets.


# What it does

WillGuard is a solution that addresses the challenges faced by users in managing their digital assets. With WillGuard, users can designate beneficiaries for their assets in their wallet, which will be automatically transferred in the event of the user's death or loss of keys. This feature provides a backup plan for lost private keys and ensures that digital assets are distributed according to the owner's intended wishes. Specifically, WillGuard allows for the setting of beneficiaries to the assets in the wallet, including 5ire tokens, ERC-115, or 5ire NFTs, which will be automatically transferred as needed.
